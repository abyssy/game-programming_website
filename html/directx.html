				<h2>Birth</h2><br/>
				<img src="../images/DirectX1.png" style="float:left;margin:20px;">
				<p>The first version of DirectX was released in September 1995 as the Windows Games SDK.</p>
				<p>It was the Win32 replacement for the DCI and WinG APIs for Windows 3.1.</p>
				<p>DirectX allowed all versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with Windows 95, to incorporate high-performance multimedia.</p>
	            <p>In late 1994, Microsoft was ready to release Windows 95, its next operating system.</p>
	            <p>DOS allowed direct access to video cards, keyboards, mice, sound devices, and all other parts of the system, while Windows 95 - with its protected memory model - restricted access to all of these, working on a much more standardized model.</p>
	            <p>Eisler, St. John, and Engstrom worked together to fix this problem, with a solution that they eventually named DirectX.</p>

				<p>DirectInput can support a lot of game input devices, it can make these devices fully play the best state and all the features. </p>
				<p>DirectPlay is mainly for the network function of the game and the support of a variety of connections, TCP / IP, IPX, Modem, serial port, etc., so that players can use a variety of networking methods to fight.</p>
